# Project Unit 1

## Criterion A: Planning

### Problem Definition
My client, the staff and faculty of a boarding school, have various different padlocks for the buildings across campus which are locked every night at 23:00. These buildings, containing mostly classrooms, have been broken into by three students two and a half weeks ago, and after an investigation the school concluded that a data break had occured where a password for one of the buildings was shared and students were able to hang out very late at night. The school is now lookign 

### Proposal Solution

### Success Criteria
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.

# Criterion B: Design
