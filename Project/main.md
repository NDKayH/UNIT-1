# Project Unit 1

## Criterion A: Planning

### Problem Definition
My client, the staff and faculty of a boarding school, have various different padlocks for the buildings across campus which are locked every night at 23:00. These buildings, containing mostly classrooms, were broken into by three students two and a half weeks ago, and after an investigation the school concluded that a data breach had occurred where a password for one of the buildings was shared and students were able to hang out very late at night. The school has opted for several future prevention methods; the first one is to change all the passwords of each and every lock on the school campus to much more complicated ones. However, they realize that because of how difficult these new passwords might be to remember, the people responsible for locking up the buildings might write down passwords on paper, which is quite insecure, and they believe a breach could happen again. To prevent this, the school is also looking for a password storage application that contains a database of all passwords. 

### Proposal Solution

### Success Criteria 
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
